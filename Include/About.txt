<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The first question people ask me after seeing this site usually pertains to my reasons for working for so long and hard to create this website. So it seems resonable to address it at the beginning. I created this website for a number of reasons, most of which shall be mentioned here, but the main one is to prove that I can. Those of you who have seen my previous websites will be surprised to know that my knowledge of PHP has hardly improved since I made those. Its just that over time I have learnt to apply that limited amount of knowledge in new ways, and this is here I get to do it. But two important technologies (I hope I'm not wrong in using this word here) that I have begun exploiting now are AJAX and Databases. Also, as someone pointed out to me, making a website consists of two main parts: designing the looks and constructing the underlying systems, and I prefer doing the latter. Facebook, which happens to be one of the most popular websites of this day (2010AD, for those who are reading this text in a future in which the days of Facebook are over) is familiar to all (and hence they will have no problem in using this website to its fullest), and is in no way a simple system. Of course, the complexity of my own website is not even close to that of the real Facebook, but I have managed to emulate most of its major features to at least some degree. But the point here is that while I get to design these systems, I dont have to bother thinking up of designed for the user interfaces for these systems, as I can copy them directly from Facebook ... in fact, almost all images used on this website had been taken from the real Facebook, although I had to manually write the associated stylesheets to make the rest of it look similar to the real version. Further, this gives me something constructive to do which might actually help me later on.</p>

<h2>Development (Basic)</h2>
<p>This section is meant only for those people who have no knowledge of web designing, and are wondering how sites like these are actually made. Those of you who know this stuff, please move on to the advanced section.</p>
<p>Now, to understand who this website was designed, you need to know a bit of how websites in general work. Whenever you type in the domain name or ip address of a computer in the address bar of your browser, your computer sends a request to the target computer's ip address in question (in case of domain names, it contacts a domain name server (DNS) to get the relevant ip address). This request contains information like your ip address, the name and version of the browser you are using, the exact name of the page you are requesting, additional data, etc. The recieving computer hands this information over to scripts which use this information (if they want) to generate the page that you asked for, and then sends the final page back to the ip address that was included in the information 'packet' you sent.</p>
<p>The page itself consists of three main parts, which you can see when you click on 'View Source' (which in somewhere in the menus). The first past are html tags which are just special keywords enclosed in less than and greater than signs (for example: &lt;u&gt;Underline&lt;/u&gt; causes the enclosed text to be underline) which tell the browser who to display and arrange stuff on a page. The second are style-sheets, which are also used to specify how things look on a page (for example: u {color:red;} causes all text enclosed in the &lt;u&gt; tags to be colored red). And the third are the scripts, written in a language called JavaScript (which has nothing to do with Java). The scripts are sent along with the page and excuted if and when required on your computer (and not the server).</p>
<p>

<h2>Development (Advanced)</h2>
<p>Those of you who know a bit about Web designing might have assumed that I am using MySQL DBs for storing user data, which happens not to be the case. The currect version of the Website is actually my third attempt at it, as it is only now that I have been able to create a decent customized DBMS for myself. While I conceed that MySQL would be better for larger databases, my DBMS is perfectly fine for the current conditions (BIT-Mesra LAN), where the number of users at any given time is not expected to be large, and high speed connections are available. The main advantages that DBMS has over MySQL Databases is that there are no restrictions to the size of content of the cells and that cells can contain arrays too. As all functions are written in PHP itself, we need not install a separate DBMS software (irrelevant in cases of web server packages like XAMPP). Disadvantages include lower efficiency (my DBMS loads data from files into a 5-dimensional array from which it is extracted when and where required; I dont really know how MySQL works), lower security (as I had to write the encryption and decryption functions myself, and they are nothing compared to DES or AES), and that a reasonable understanding of how the System works is required for using it to the fullest. The number of related functions is obviously lower than PHP's inbuilt MySQL functions, but are enough for my purposes (whenever I need a new function, I can just write one).</p>
<p>Moving on to Ajax, I had used it only in the more important features of the website, so as to avoid the unnecessary complexity that accompanies it. Most tutorials and websites I have seen have multiple Ajax functions for different parts of the process, but I condensed all of it into a single function that basically takes three arguments : the PHP Page to which the request is to be sent, the POST type arguments to be sent along as part of the request, and the ID of the element in which the response is to be displayed. While I know that Ajax responses can be put to better uses, for now, this has been sufficient for my purposes. Also, the interpretation and manipulation of more complex responses requires a greater proficiency at Javascript than I currently possess.</p>
<p>Now, as this website as undergone primary testing only on Opera 10, non-optimal performance may be expected if you are using other browsers. Not that I have not even tested this website on other browers (I have IE, Chrome, Firefox, Opera & Safari installed on my machine right now), but the fact is that as different browsers interpret the same code in different ways, it is difficult for me to make this website work perfectly on each of them, especially as it is difficult to determine on the server side which browser a client is using. Note that my Ajax functions do not work properly for Firefox and IE, and the only way I could get the website to function on them was to reload the page for every action. Further, as the Chat Feature is completely Ajax dependent, it is disabled for the aforementioned browsers.</p>

<h2>Working</h2>
<p>This website's systems can be broadly divided into four categories. The first one is the Database and the associated functions as described above. The second category consists libraries which use these functions (obviously along with PHP's inbuilt functions) to manipulate data and generate dynamic content for the website (this part is the largest, and consists of more than 250KB of code; and yes, I have manually written every bit of it). These librararies are initialized through the Systems.php file.</p>
<p>The third category includes the Action Pages (if you check the source code, you shall see multiple references to Action.php and Ajax.php) which invokes the data manipulation function from the libraries to do stuff, and the fourth is the Construct which invokes the content generating functions and presents the output to the user in the proper layout. The Construct consists of 3 files : Construct.php (check out the address bar right now), Image.php (which returns the correct image file after autodetecting its format using just a User/Photo/Album/Event/Page/Group IDN) & the Index.php (which is the login page)</p>

<h2>Things that could have been (or can still be)</h2>
<p>Had this not been a personal project (referring to that fact that I can do whatever and whenever I want) this website would have had a number of features that arent there right now. The ones I mention below are the ones that I think I have proved (to website developers) I could have made, had the point I was trying to make not been made already.</p>
<p>
<li>Confirmation Boxes for actions like Friend Requests, Pokes & Punches, etc, which are not too difficult to make, but rather cumbersome.</li>
<li>Smileys, for the Chat Feature (suggested by Anurag Dubey)</li>
<li>User Activity posts on his/her wall, which nobody cares about anyway.</li>
<li>Notes, which I wanted to, but saw no point in making as nobody would use it.</li>
<li>Videos, uploading of which would take up space on the server (excess of which I do not have) and the fact that I would have needed video convertors for multiple formats with command line support.</li>
</p>
<p>The following are features that I would have liked to have on my website, but cannot, for some reason or the other. Any help in the following will be greatly appriciated.</p>
<p>
<li>Games, which would be a major success here in BIT, as games are banned on the real Facebook, and this would provide a platform for BITians to set actual highscores among friends (who among who has not been irked by the fact that after you played a Facebook Flash game really well, there was still some idiot from half-way around the globe who has a score much greater than your own). If you think you can create even simple games in Flash or Java (and are willing to do so), please contact me so that I can give you the specifications of how your game is supposed to interact with my server (better ideas shall obviously be entertained).</li>
<li>Ajax compatibility issues, as mentioned above in the Development Section.</li>
</p>

<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>While your data is stored in an encrypted format, the cryptographic algorithm used is not spectacular, and may be cracked with little effort. Further, all data is visible to and modifyable by the creator, hence please do not upload or write anything on this website that you wish to keep absolutely confidential. However, I resonable degree of privacy is maintained such that people with whom you are not friends cannot access anything more than you basic profile information.</p>
